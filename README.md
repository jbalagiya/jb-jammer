## :star2: About the Project
This project is about a jammer in the 433MHz band, the frequency of the jammer can be changed using the menu.


<!-- Features -->
### :dart: Features

- Disruptor in the  433MHz/315MHz  band
- Frequency control using the menu

<!-- Getting Started -->
Getting Started

We use 433MHz/315MHz Transmitter and Arduino.

- Arduino Nano
-  433MHz/315MHz Transmitter

Make the connections according to the table and schematic below.

* Arduino and  433MHz/315MHz Transmitter.

| Arduino| 433MHz/315MHz Transmitter|

### :gear: Installation

Before uploading the code you in Arduino IDE
<!-- Usage -->
## :eyes: Usage

In the first step, by selecting Arduino serial monitor 9600 band  the desired frequency from the options in the menu, the device will start sending a signal to the 433 MHz band, then if necessary
